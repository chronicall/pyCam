pyCam
=====

A simple webcam application using pygame's camera module. It searches for all cameras connected to the computer and uses the first one on the list, if it finds any.

Dependencies
=====

To be able to run, you'll have to have python's (2.7) pygame installed.

Usage

Run with python pyCam.py. Pressing the spacebar after the camera has been started will save a .jpg snapshot, with the current timestamp as a filename, in the root directory of the application.
